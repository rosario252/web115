		<h2>Home</h2>
		<p>Welcome! This GitHub page will hold my work done for my WEB115 class. 
		This class will introduce me to the fundamentals of client-side internet 
		programming, focusing on the <strong>Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong> 
		standards and best practices used in the industry.</p>
		<p>I've already learn how to create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a previous 
		class. The goal for this class will be to create websites that are functional, modern, 
		and meet current web standards.</p>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I'm a Software Development student at Central Piedmont Community College. I have become 
		passionate and have gain interest on the creation of websites.</p>
