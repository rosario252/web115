		<h1>Rosario Sanchez's Radiant Swan</h1>
		<h2>Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Rosario Sanchez</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2025 
		<a href="index.html">WEB115-N801: Web Markup and Scripting</a> course with my instructor, Professor von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites 
		will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that 
		is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins 
		or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
		<p>Signed: <em>Rosario Sanchez, 21 January 2025</em></p>
